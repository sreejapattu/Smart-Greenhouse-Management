ðŸ“Š Field Descriptions
Field	Description
Timestamp	Time when the readings were recorded (can be added via RTC or external logger)
Temperature (Â°C)	Ambient temperature from the DHT22 sensor
Humidity (%)	Relative humidity from the DHT22 sensor
Soil Moisture (%)	Calculated from analog input (mapped from raw value 1023â€“0 to 0â€“100%)
Light Intensity	Raw analog value from light sensor (e.g., 0â€“1023, higher = brighter)
Irrigation Status	ON if soil moisture < 40%, otherwise OFF

ðŸ§ª Sample Data Logging Code (Optional Extension)
To store this dataset on an SD card or print it in CSV format:

Serial.print(temperature); Serial.print(",");
Serial.print(humidity); Serial.print(",");
Serial.print(moisturePercentage); Serial.print(",");
Serial.print(lightIntensity); Serial.print(",");
Serial.println(digitalRead(RELAYPIN) == HIGH ? "ON" : "OFF");
Or add a real-time clock (RTC) module (like DS3231) to log timestamps.

ðŸ”§ Use Cases for the Dataset
Graphing trends (moisture vs time, temperature vs humidity)

Trigger analysis (what conditions turn irrigation on/off)

Optimizing watering schedules based on moisture and sunlight

Machine Learning inputs for predictive control
